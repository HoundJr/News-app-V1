The witness reported the incident to Crime Stoppers, saying the seabobs appeared to have a black tow harness with shackles and weights on either side.</p>\n<p>The bulk carrier docked at port the next morning (24 January, 2023), and AFP, NSWPF and Australian Border Force (ABF) officers searched the vessel. NSWPF divers retrieved six waterproof duffle bags hidden in a section of the hull known as the sea chest. Inside the bags, they found 82 packages, weighing about 80kg, which tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p>Early on 25 January, 2023, witnesses on a ferry reported seeing two men in the water in the Newcastle harbour.</p>\n<p>Police arrested the two men onshore in the area later that day and retrieved multiple items from the rocks and shoreline where they had returned, including a black climbing belt, diving googles with torches, a black flipper, diving bag, bolt cutters, diving gloves, pliers and a pocket knife.</p>\n<p>Investigators also executed a search warrant on their vehicle, seizing items including diving equipment, electronic devices, receipts and passports.</p>\n<p>The court heard the men had been diving at the bulk carrier in an unsuccessful attempt to find and retrieve the illicit drugs.</p>\n<p>Investigations later found the pair had flown into Brisbane from Denpasar, Indonesia, separately on 17 and 18 January, 2023, just a few days before the bulk carrier arrived in the Newcastle area.</p>\n<p>On their drive south through NSW, the men purchased two seabobs worth $56,000 on the Gold Coast, a scuba set in Nelson Bay, and tools from a hardware store in Newcastle.</p>\n<p>Forensic analysis of the men’s phones revealed conversations discussing the logistics of retrieving the cocaine from the vessel in an encrypted app group chat titled ‘Finding Nemo’.</p>\n<p>AFP divers later found both seabobs fastened to a pier pylon in the Hunter River at Newcastle.</p>\n<p>The men were each charged with one count of attempting to possess a large commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, contrary to section 307.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth). Both men pleaded guilty to the offence.</p>\n<p>AFP Detective Superintendent Peter Fogarty said the cocaine, which had an estimated street value of $26 million, equated to about 400,000 street-level deals.</p>\n<p>“Criminals view Australia as a lucrative market to sell illicit drugs, and will go to great lengths, even risking their own safety, to make a quick buck,” Det Supt Fogarty said.</p>\n<p>“Divers hired by criminal syndicates are a cog in the wheel of organised crime, and they will be pursued and apprehended, no matter where they sit in a syndicate’s hierarchy.</p>\n<p>“This result is testament to our ongoing collaboration with our partners, both then and now.</p>\n<p>“Criminals are relentless at targeting our community for illicit ventures, which is why our close working relationships with partners such as NSW Police Force and Australian Border Force (ABF) are so important.”</p>\n<p>NSW Police Force Detective Superintendent Peter Faux said the agency used all its resources and capabilities to identify and target those committing serious crimes which impacted the community.</p>\n<p>“It is an example of how we work closely with our law enforcement and intelligence partners to stop large amounts of illicit drugs from entering our communities,” Det Supt Faux said.</p>\n<p>ABF Superintendent Geoff Quinn said the sentencing of the individuals involved in this elaborate plot was a victory against those criminals who sought to exploit Australia’s borders.</p>\n<p>“This court outcome is the result of the incredible work showcased by our ABF officers alongside their counterparts at the AFP and NSW Police Force,” Supt Quinn said.</p>\n<p>“The ABF is Australia’s only border security agency dedicated to protecting our physical border and preventing illicit trade, and this outcome serves as a warning to criminals that we’re acutely aware of what you’re up to.</p>\n<p>“The ABF’s work with partner agencies helps identify, target and disrupt the nefarious activities of serious organised crime groups irrespective of how clever they think they are.”</p>\n<h5>Note to media:</h5>\n<p>Media are encouraged to include help-seeking information in stories about illicit drugs to minimise any negative impact on people in the community.

Security staff referred the matter to Australian Border Force (ABF) officers, who identified it as bundles of cash. A search of the woman’s luggage and clothing allegedly found $191,850 in Australian dollars, along with a small amount of Euros and other currency.</p>\n<p>The AFP responded to a request for assistance at the airport and the cash was seized. The woman had allegedly failed to declare the money in her luggage and told officers it was savings, with some of it given to her by her family, including her son and daughter-in-law. During the CACT investigation, it was identified that the son and daughter-in-law had purchased six WA properties to the value of about $4.5 million in the past six years, some of which were not mortgaged.</p>\n<p>The couple’s spending and accumulated asset portfolio did not appear to align with earnings they had declared to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) over the relevant financial years. Police alleged the couple hid their true earnings to ensure they paid less tax than required to the ATO.</p>\n<p>During the investigation, the couple also allegedly purchased a property in Gnangara (WA), worth \r\njust over $2 million.\r\nThe CACT – which brings together the AFP, Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, ATO, \r\nAUSTRAC, and ABF – applied to the Perth District Court on 24 June, 2025, to have multiple assets \r\nbelonging to the woman and the couple restrained under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth).​</p>\n<p>​The restrained assets include:</p>\n<p>• Seven properties in Western Australia collectively worth about $6.5 million, including the Gnangara residential property worth just over $2 million;</p>\n<p>• The almost $192,000 in cash seized at Perth Airport; and</p>\n<p>• A bank account containing about $236,000.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth’s proceeds of crime laws provide expansive tools for the restraint of both proceeds and instruments of crime, as well as pecuniary penalty orders and unexplained wealth orders, based on a civil standard of proof. These laws can also operate when there is no related criminal investigation or prosecution, which is the situation in this case.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth’s proceeds of crime laws also provide people whose assets have been restrained with a number of protections, including the ability to have their assets excluded from restraint, if they can satisfy the court that such assets are not the proceeds or instruments of crime, and have been legitimately acquired.</p>\n<p>AFP Western Command acting Superintendent Chris Colley said the mandate of the CACT was to deprive offenders of the proceeds, instruments and benefits of their crimes, and to punish and deter them from breaching the law or reinvesting in further criminal activities.</p>\n<p>“The AFP and its partners in the CACT will hold people to account and make sure they are able to lawfully justify the wealth and assets they accumulate,” a/Supt Colley said. “Those who acquire wealth unlawfully consider the confiscation of their assets to be as much, or more, of a punishment than any potential prison sentence.</p>\n<p>“The CACT is committed to seeing the legal process through to completion; pursuing confiscation orders in relation to the restrained assets and property.”</p>\n<p>ABF Superintendent John Eldridge said there was no limit to the amount of cash travellers were allowed to bring in or take out of the country, however it must be declared if it was more than $10,000 AUD.</p>\n<p>“The ABF and partners use intelligence-based profiling and behavioural analysis to target people attempting to depart Australia with undeclared excess cash, including allegedly in support of money laundering networks and serious organised crime groups,” Supt Eldridge said.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to work with law enforcement agencies to remove profit as a motive for criminal \r\nacts.”\r\nAt the conclusion of successful legal proceedings, confiscated assets are liquidated by AFSA, with \r\nthe proceeds placed in the Commonwealth Confiscated Assets Account (CAA).</p>\n<p>​Funds in the CAA can be reinvested by the Commonwealth Minister for Home Affairs into \r\nprograms which support crime prevention, law enforcement, drug treatment, and other related \r\nmeasures that support the safety and security of the community. ​</p>\n</body>\n</html>"

The ABF handed the matter to the AFP for investigation.</p>\n<p>It will be alleged the man sent the individual weapon parts from the US under false descriptions to false names at multiple addresses in Queensland and Victoria. All nine packages were intercepted by the ABF before they could be delivered. The packages were sent to the AFP for forensic analysis.</p>\n<p>Police will allege the man planned to assemble the firearm parts in Australia and sell the firearms for $20,000 each.</p>\n<p>The AFP charged the man with nine counts of attempting to traffic in firearm parts, contrary to sections 11.1 and 361.2 of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years’ imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The man appeared before Brisbane Magistrates Court on 27 June, 2025.

It also underscores the importance of our close partnerships with domestic and international law enforcement agencies in disrupting illicit importation attempts.”</p>\n<p>​</p>\n</body>\n</html>"

If you know abuse is happening right now or a child is at risk, call police immediately on 000.</p>\n<p>If you or someone you know is impacted by child sexual abuse and online exploitation, support services are available.</p>\n<p>Advice and support for parents and carers about how they can help protect children online can be found at the ThinkUKnow website, an AFP-led education program designed to prevent online child sexual exploitation.</p>\n<p>For more information on the role of the ACCCE, what is online child sexual exploitation and how to report it visit the ACCCE website.</p>\n<p>Note to media</p>\n<p>Use of term 'CHILD ABUSE' MATERIAL not 'CHILD PORNOGRAPHY'</p>\n<p>The correct legal term is Child Abuse Material – the move to this wording was among amendments to Commonwealth legislation in 2019 to more accurately reflect the gravity of the crimes and the harm inflicted on victims.</p>\n<p>Use of the phrase 'child pornography' is inaccurate and benefits child sex abusers because it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>indicates legitimacy and compliance on the part of the victim and therefore legality on the part of the abuser; and</li>\n<li>conjures images of children posing in 'provocative' positions, rather than suffering horrific abuse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every photograph or video captures an actual situation where a child has been abused. ​</p>\n</body>\n</html>"

The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Australian Border Force (ABF) officers in Queensland identified and intercepted a sea cargo consignment from Thailand on 4 July, 2025, following its arrival into the Port of Brisbane. The illicit drugs were allegedly concealed in eight wooden crates declared as 'UV protective fabrics'.</p>\n<p>ABF assessed multiple red flags in relation to the consignment. Forensic testing established the shipment contained 597kg of methamphetamine wrapped inside 200 rolls of fabric and the matter was handed over to the AFP.</p>\n<p>The AFP removed the illicit drugs and the consignment was delivered to a warehouse in Bowen Hills, in Brisbane's inner north.</p>\n<p>It will be alleged the three men were in the vicinity of the warehouse when the consignment was delivered. Two of the men allegedly began to unravel the rolls of fabric, as the 24-year-old attended a business to buy an electronic scale to allegedly weigh the illicit drugs they were expecting.</p>\n<p>The three men were then arrested by the Queensland Joint Organised Crime Task Force and taken to Brisbane City Watchhouse, where they were subsequently charged.</p>\n<p>During subsequent search warrants of the warehouse and two vehicles, investigators located and seized the contents of the consignment, four mobile phones, about $7000 cash, and tools suspected to be used in accessing the methamphetamine.</p>\n<p>Inquiries into the criminal syndicate remain ongoing.</p>\n<p>AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer said the result demonstrated the commitment of the AFP to combat transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>“The people behind importations like this have no regard for the harm and damage that illicit drugs wreak on the Australian community every minute of every day,\" Det Supt Telfer said.</p>\n<p>“Methamphetamine is a devastating drug and causes harm not just to the user, but also their loved ones and the wider community. This amount of methamphetamine could have resulted in about six million individual street deals.</p>\n<p>“Criminals will stop at nothing to import harmful drugs into Australia to fill their pockets and are indifferent to the harm they cause.\"</p>\n<p>ABF Acting Assistant Commissioner James Copeman commended border officers for their efforts.</p>\n<p>“This was an incredibly sophisticated concealment that could have easily evaded detection – but not by our officers. The skill and vigilance of ABF teams at the border ensured this dangerous cargo was stopped before it could reach Australian streets,\" Acting Assistant Commissioner Copeman said.</p>\n<p>“The sheer volume of methamphetamine hidden within legitimate-looking fabric rolls speaks to the lengths criminal syndicates will go to, but it also highlights the extraordinary capability of ABF officers to detect and disrupt even the most convincing smuggling attempts.</p>\n<p>“This outcome is the result of world-class targeting and a deep understanding of import patterns by our officers. Without that expertise, nearly 600 kilograms of illicit drugs may have slipped through.</p>\n<p>“The ABF's detection work was critical in enabling the AFP to carry out a successful operation. This is another powerful example of what can be achieved through collaboration across law enforcement agencies.\"</p>\n<p>QPS Detective Inspector Stephen Tiernan, from the Queensland Joint Organised Crime Task Force, said the arrest was the result of a united front in the fight against organised criminal activity.</p>\n<p>“The QJOCTF will continue to target and dismantle these criminal networks, using all available resources and intelligence, to prevent illicit drugs impacting the Queensland community,\" Det Insp Tiernan said.   ​</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note to media: </p>\n<p>Media are encouraged to include help-seeking information in stories about illicit drugs to minimise any negative impact on people in the community.
