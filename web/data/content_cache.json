These steps include correcting personal information that is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading when it is reasonable to do so.</p><p>Regular audits and quality inspections are conducted to ensure the accuracy and integrity of information is checked regularly and any systemic data quality issues are identified and resolved promptly.</p><h2>Access to personal information</h2><p>Individuals can access information about themselves in departmental documents (other than exempt documents) under the Privacy Act 1988 or Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act).</p><p>An individual can seek to obtain original documents or copies of personal information by approaching us. ​​</p><p>For more information, refer to How to make a FOI request</p><h2>Corrections of personal information</h2><p>Individuals can seek to amend or annotate their personal information. How we amend or annotate a record depends on a number of circumstances.</p><h3>Australian citizens</h3><p>Australian citizens seeking to change their personal information on their evidence of Australian citizenship such as name or date of birth should apply to Change a citizenship certificate with the required documents and fee in accordance with instructions on the form.</p><h3>ImmiCard holders and changes under FOI and Privacy Acts</h3><p>Requests to change biographic details on an ImmiCard (name or date of birth) can be made by completing an ImmiCard amendment request. Applicants will need to attach official documentary evidence and/or an Australian Government issued Change of Name or Marriage Certificate to support the requested change.</p><p>We will consider issuing a new ImmiCard with amended biographic details following assessment of the online request and the evidence provided. The request might be referred to a case manager for an identity assessment as part of the visa process.</p><h3>Non Australian citizens (permanent and temporary visa holders) with supporting documentation</h3><p>Where an individual has official documentation in support of an amendment or correction, such as a passport or Australian Government issued Change of Name or Marriage Certificate, they should submit their request in writing using Form 1022 - Notification of Change in Circumstance or Form 1023 - Notification of Incorrect Answers. The form can be submitted through IMMIaccount or sent to the nearest departmental office together with high-resolution scans (600dpi) of certified documentary evidence to support the identity change. The change can be actioned by the authorised case officer or relevant visa processing area.</p><h3>Where the change is not supported by documented evidence</h3><p>Where an individual’s request is not supported by official documentary  evidence, and a decision is made under the Privacy Act to refuse access, the  individual can apply under the FOI Act to amend or annotate their personal  records. For more information, refer to How to make a FOI request.</p><p>Under the legislation that governs it, we do not have any power to ‘create’ a new identity, including where a person chooses to change their name. Under Australian law, the State and Territory Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages (RBDM) are the responsible authorities for preferred name changes.</p><h2>Privacy Impact Assessment Register</h2><p>In accordance with s 15(1) of the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code (the Privacy Code), the Department is required to maintain a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Register of all PIAs completed since 1 July 2018.</p><h2>Feedback and review bodies​</h2><h3>Global feedback unit</h3><p>If you want to provide us with feedback about our service, complete an online feedback form or write to:</p><p>The Manager<br/> Global Feedback Unit<br/> GPO Box 241<br/> Melbourne Vic. 3001<br/> Australia</p><h3>Australian Information Commissioner</h3><p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner handles complaints from the public into how an organisation or agency handles your personal information.</p><p>You can make a complaint to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner if your personal information has been mishandled.
